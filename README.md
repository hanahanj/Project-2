# Playlist Generator
Bootcamp Project 2

  ## Description
 <!-- This project is a Node.js application using express.js to create a browser-based note taking application. -->

 This is a MVC application to generate personalized playlists on spotify as well as view other user's playlists and maybe appreciate them somehow...



 ## User Story

As a music lovers
I WANT to be able to curate my own list of personalized playlists
SO THAT I can find the perfect music for a particular activity
SHARE my personal tastes with other users
AND find new music by viewing other users playlists.



## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I arrive at the site
THEN I am prompted to sign up or log in
WHEN I have logged in, 
THEN I am presented with my existing playlists
WHEN I click on a playlist
THEN I can view all the songs in that playlist
THEN I can add songs to this playlist
THEN I can delete songs from this playlist
WHEN I click on a play button
THEN the playlist starts to play 
WHEN I click on an ADD NEW PLAYLIST button
THEN I am prompted to name and (MAYBE) tag or filter the new playlist
THEN I am prompted to search for songs I can add to the new playlist
WHEN I am done adding songs to the playlist
THEN I can publish it, so it joins all my other playlists in my profile

<!-- V2 -->

WHEN I search for other user's playlists
THEN I see a list of other users, with some info about their profile, playlists, etc.
WHEN I click on one of those users, I see a list of their playlists
WHEN I click on another user's playlist, I can play that playlist.
